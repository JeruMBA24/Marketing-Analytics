Summary:

This dataset contains information about a bank's marketing campaign to get customers to sign up for a "term deposit" (a type of savings account).

Size: The list contains 41,188 rows of customer data.

Customer Details: It tracks things like age (ranging from 17 to 98 years old), job type (like admin, retired, or student), education, and whether they have any existing loans.

The Campaign: It records how the bank contacted people (via phone or cellular), how long the conversations lasted, and what time of year they were called.

Results: The main goal was to see if the customer said "yes" or "no" to the offer.

36,548 people (about 89%) said No.

4,640 people (about 11%) said Yes.

In short, it is a tool used to study which customers are most likely to say "yes" to bank offers based on their personal background and how they were contacted.
